        "        Note: your test set should be held out until final evaluation, after you have finished optimizing your model. When trying different hyperparameters, please cut a separate validation split (10-20% of total training set size) from your training data to assess generalization importance. This can be done either manually or by passing the `validation_split` parameter to `model.fit()`.  A single validation split will suffice, you do not need to use full K-fold cross-validation for this assignment.\n",

Try your best to improve the model performance, and explain the reason behind any choices you make. You should experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons or layers, optimizer type, and so forth. You can also apply regularization, batch normalization, or data augmentation as you see fit. Please show all steps, so we can follow the progression of your improvements to the model. Evaluate your model. You should report training, validation, and test accuracy (all three).\n",
        "        Model 2: Second, unfreeze the last block of VGG16 (block5), re-train and evaluate the model. You can keep the same set of best hyperparameters that you found while optimizing Model 1, or try new hyperparameters, it's up to you.\n",
